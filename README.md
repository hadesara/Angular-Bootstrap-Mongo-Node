BANM Seed
===========

Seed for building large applications on BANM (Bootstrap, Angular, Node, Mongo) stack

To get started

1. Install
	- node from http://nodejs.org/download/
	- npm from http://nodejs.org/download/
	- mongo from http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/
2. In terminal/command line and at root directory of source code and run 'npm install'
3. run 'node app'
4. goto localhost:3000 for demo

About the architecture: It is segregated in terms of 'client' to represent what will go on the client side and 'api' for all the api calls. It has a basic 'user' module and the idea is to structure the application modules based on the features (easy for multi-phased deployments). Feel free to use it in your own project, in return I would love to get some feed back
